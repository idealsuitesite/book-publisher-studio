# Publishing Engine — Level 2 Design Review

**Status:** 🟡 Round 2 — all 5 round-1 questions plus 1 new architectural decision **LOCKED** by explicit CTO decision (2026-07-18). **Not yet ✅ APPROVED** — the CTO's own review message ended mid-sentence at "Mon verdict CTO," with no final verdict statement following it, and opened by stating the review was "approuvée à environ 90%," not 100%. Per `docs/DESIGN_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`'s approval gate ("not implementation-ready until it says ✅ APPROVED with a date"), this document does not treat the missing 10% as filled in by assumption. **No branch, no code, until the verdict is completed and confirmed.**
**Date:** 2026-07-18 (round 1) / 2026-07-18 (round 2 decisions)
**Sprint:** Sprint 8 — confirmed as this sprint's target by explicit CTO direction, following Sprint 7's release (`v0.8.0-alpha`).

---

## 1. Objectives

Close the gap between what this project has always said it would do (`docs/VERSIONS.md`'s own `v0.9.0-alpha`-and-later roadmap has named "Kindle / Kobo / Lulu / IngramSpark / Amazon KDP export targets" since Sprint 4) and what actually exists today: three format renderers (PDF/DOCX/EPUB) that produce generically correct output, and zero platform-specific packaging. Prepare a finished book for distribution to at least one real platform — real metadata requirements, real cover specs, real pre-submission validation — not just "export a PDF and hope it's accepted."

This is genuinely new territory, not an extension of an existing engine (unlike Sprint 6's Professional Layout Engine, which extended `LayoutEngine`). `docs/architecture/diagrams/PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md` §2.5 mapped this at Level 1 (2026-07-17, approved) without deciding implementation detail — that's this document's job.

---

## 2. Current State — Evidence, Not Assumptions

Every claim below was confirmed by reading the actual code or the actual docs, not inferred from a name.

**`docs/VISION.md`'s original framing (confirmed via `grep`, no dedicated "Publishing Engine" section exists in that document at all):**
> "**Later:** Kindle, Apple Books, Kobo, Lulu, IngramSpark, Amazon KDP — each a new `IRenderer` implementation behind the same port, no Domain changes required" (`docs/VISION.md` line 26)

This treats every platform as **just another format**, at the same architectural level as PDF/DOCX/EPUB today — no separate engine, no post-render step, no new port. **Superseded by Decision 1 below.**

**`PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md`'s later framing (§2.5):** a `PublishingTarget` port, analogous to `Renderer<TOutput>` but operating **after** rendering. **This is the framing Decision 1 locks.**

**Confirmed by reading `backend/src/domain/models/Book.ts` directly, not assumed:**
- `FrontMatter` (`cover`/`titlePage`/`copyrightPage`/`dedication`/`toc`/`preface`/`foreword`/`introduction`/`acknowledgments`) and `BackMatter` (`bibliography`/`glossary`/`index`) are real, fully-typed interfaces on `Book`.
- `grep`-confirmed: **zero** references to `frontMatter`, `backMatter`, `titlePage`, `copyrightPage`, `bibliography`, or `glossary` in any of `DOCXRenderer.ts`, `PDFRenderer.ts`, `EPUBRenderer.ts`. Only `frontMatter.toc` is consumed anywhere (Sprint 6's automatic TOC generation).
- `BookMetadata` already carries `isbn`/`issn`/`coverImage`/`copyright`/`license`/`publicationDate` — real fields a platform submission would need — but `ASTBuilder` never populates most of them from a real DOCX import (Sprint 5's `MetadataRule` already flags this on every real import). Publishing Engine inherits this gap; it doesn't cause it and can't fix it alone.

**Confirmed by reading `ExportManuscriptUseCase.ts` directly:** the current pipeline is `parse → normalize → build → theme → typography → paginate → render(Buffer)`. Nothing downstream of `this.renderer.render(...)` exists today.

**Confirmed by reading `ExportController.ts` directly:** `POST /api/manuscripts/export` today takes `theme`/`format`/`layout` and returns raw rendered bytes. No platform concept exists anywhere in the current HTTP surface.

**A real, already-decided dependency, not new to this review:** `docs/architecture/diagrams/VALIDATION_ENGINE.md`'s own Decision 2 (Sprint 5, approved) explicitly deferred `PostRenderValidation` to "likely `Publishing Engine`." **This is the commitment Decision 3 below closes.**

**A real, unreconciled backlog overlap, confirmed by reading `docs/TODO.md` directly:** the Backlog section independently lists "Kindle / Kobo / Lulu / IngramSpark / Amazon KDP export targets" (line 188) alongside the Level-1-mapped Publishing Engine item — reconciled by Decision 2 below (KDP first, others become future `PublishingTarget` implementations, same list).

## 3. Locked Decisions (Round 2, 2026-07-18)

Each decision below records the CTO's own stated reasoning, not just the outcome — matching this project's own discipline that "a round that changes nothing is still worth recording" and that rationale, not just the ruling, is what a future contributor needs.

### Decision 1 — `PublishingTarget` is a new Domain port, not another `Renderer<TOutput>` implementation

**Locked.** `VISION.md`'s original "just another `IRenderer`" framing is superseded.

**CTO's rationale (verbatim reasoning):** `Renderer` today does exactly one thing — `Book → Renderer → PDF/DOCX/EPUB`. Publishing Engine does something categorically different — `Book → Renderer → Output → PublishingTarget → Validation → Packaging → PublishingReport`. These are two completely different responsibilities: one produces a file, the other prepares and validates a *distribution*. Conflating them into one port would force every `Renderer` implementation (including the 3 that only ever need to produce bytes) to carry distribution concerns that don't belong to them.

### Decision 2 — Amazon KDP only for Sprint 8; a real spike is required first

**Locked.** Kobo, Apple Books, Lulu, and IngramSpark are explicitly out of scope for this sprint — each becomes a future `PublishingTarget` implementation (`KoboTarget`, `AppleBooksTarget`, `LuluTarget`, `IngramTarget`) added later without touching the port itself, per Decision 6's decomposition below. A real Commit-0 spike (`backend/spikes/kdp-publishing-spike.ts`) verifying KDP's actual current metadata requirements, cover image spec, and file-naming/submission rules is required before any `KDPTarget`/`KDPRuleSet` code is written — matching the ADR-0019/0020/0030 precedent exactly, confirmed necessary by the CTO alongside this decision.

### Decision 3 — `PostRenderValidation` belongs to Publishing Engine, as a new rule family (not `ValidationEngine`)

**Locked.**

**CTO's rationale:** `ValidationEngine` validates the **manuscript** (the `Book` AST, pre-render). Publishing Engine validates the **rendered output** (post-render — real page count, real embedded-font validity, real EPUB structural validity, real KDP-specific compliance). These are two different things being validated, at two different pipeline stages, by two different engines — not a duplication, a genuinely new rule family living in Publishing Engine, orchestrated the same way `ValidationEngine` orchestrates `ValidationRule`s (mirrors `RuleRegistry`'s existing shape, per Decision 6's `SubmissionValidator` component below), closing `VALIDATION_ENGINE.md`'s Decision 2 open commitment without moving it into `ValidationEngine` itself.

### Decision 4 — A new route, `POST /api/manuscripts/publish` — never a field on `/export`

**Locked.**

**CTO's rationale:** Export and Publish are two completely different Use Cases. `Export → generates a file.` `Publish → prepares a distribution.` A single request parameter can't honestly represent that difference — `/export`'s contract (raw bytes, generic `Content-Type`) is correct for what it does and shouldn't grow a platform-aware branch. `/publish` returns something structurally different: a real `PublishingReport` (and, later, a packaged submission bundle), not a file stream.

### Decision 5 — No real KDP submission in Sprint 8. Validation and packaging only.

**Locked, 100%, no reservations stated.**

**CTO's explicit boundary (verbatim):** Sprint 8 must **NOT**: create a KDP account, call Amazon, send a book, or use any credentials. Sprint 8 must **only** produce a `PublishingReport` — PASS / FAIL / Warnings. No remote API calls, no authentication, no real publication event, under any circumstance this sprint.

### Decision 6 (new, CTO-initiated) — Publishing Engine is decomposed into 5 named components from the start, not a single monolithic class

**Locked.** The CTO's own stated concern: a first draft that mixes validation, packaging, KDP-specific rules, orchestration, and reporting into one undifferentiated "Publishing Engine" would need refactoring the moment a second platform (Kobo, Apple Books, Lulu) is added. Decomposing now, even with only one real target, means future platforms are new implementations of an existing shape, not a rewrite of the core — the same reasoning that has governed every port this project has built (`Renderer<TOutput>`, `LayoutSelector`).

The CTO's own component list, mapped onto this project's existing Clean Architecture layering (Domain/Application/Infrastructure — the mapping itself is this document's contribution, not restated from the CTO's message, which named the components but not their layer):

| Component | Layer | Shape, mirroring an existing precedent in this codebase |
|---|---|---|
| `PublishingTarget` | Domain — **port** | One method, e.g. `prepare(book: Book, renderedOutputs: RenderedOutputs): PublishingReport` — mirrors `Renderer<TOutput>`/`LayoutSelector`'s existing port shape (ADR-0012) |
| `KDPTarget` | Domain or Infrastructure — **concrete class, only implementation this sprint** | Implements `PublishingTarget`; internally calls `Packaging` and `SubmissionValidator`. Port-vs-class placement follows `docs/DEVELOPER_HANDBOOK.md`'s existing judgment rule once Decision 2's spike confirms whether KDP-specific logic needs any Infrastructure-level I/O (file packaging) or stays pure |
| `Packaging` | Domain (pure) or Infrastructure (if real file I/O is needed for a submission bundle) | Assembles a `PublishingBundle` (book file + cover file + metadata) from the `Book` + a `Renderer`'s output — a data-shaping step, not validation |
| `SubmissionValidator` | Domain — **concrete class**, orchestrates a rule registry | Mirrors `ValidationEngine`/`RuleRegistry`'s exact existing shape (ADR-0027/0028) — a `PostRenderValidationRule[]` family, each rule pure and independent, producing `ValidationIssue`-shaped findings. This is Decision 3's rule family, named per the CTO's own naming here |
| `PublishingReport` | Domain — **model** | Mirrors `ValidationReport`/`QualityScore`'s existing shape — `status: 'PASS' \| 'FAIL'`, `issues: PublishingIssue[]`, `warnings: string[]` |
| `PublishingUseCase` | Application — **use case** | Mirrors `ExportManuscriptUseCase`'s exact existing shape (`UseCase<TRequest, TResponse>`) — orchestrates the existing pipeline (parse→normalize→build→theme→typography→paginate→render) then hands the result to `PublishingTarget.prepare()` |

**A KDP-specific consequence of this decomposition, folded in from the CTO's separate risk note below (§6):** KDP's own real requirements (cover pixel dimensions, required metadata fields, file-naming rules) must live in an isolated, swappable `KDPRuleSet` — data, not hardcoded conditionals inside `KDPTarget`/`SubmissionValidator` — so a future KDP spec change is a data update, not an engine change. Mirrors this project's existing registry pattern (`getTheme`, `ManualLayoutSelector`'s registry) rather than inventing a new one.

## 4. Architecture Impact

Updates `PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md` §3's dependency diagram's final stage from a placeholder box to the decomposed shape locked by Decision 6:

```
                    ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                    │   Renderer port       │  (built: DOCX/PDF/EPUB, Sprints 2-3B)
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                    ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                    │  PublishingUseCase     │  Application layer, orchestrates below
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                    ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                    │ PublishingTarget port │  NEW — KDPTarget (Sprint 8, only impl)
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                 ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
      ┌──────────▼──────────┐   ┌──────────▼──────────┐
      │      Packaging        │   │  SubmissionValidator  │  uses KDPRuleSet (data,
      │  (book+cover+metadata)│   │  (PostRenderValidation │  isolated from engine logic)
      │                        │   │   rule family)         │
      └──────────┬──────────┘   └──────────┬──────────┘
                    └─────────────┬─────────────┘
                    ┌──────────▼──────────┐
                    │   PublishingReport     │  PASS / FAIL / Warnings
                    └────────────────────┘
```

`Renderer<TOutput>`'s existing contract is unchanged — everything above is new and additive (same "additive over signature-break" discipline as ADR-0022/ADR-0027/ADR-0029). `POST /api/manuscripts/publish` (Decision 4) is the new Presentation-layer entry point calling `PublishingUseCase`.

---

## 5. Functional / Technical Specifications

Structural shapes locked now (they don't depend on any KDP-specific real value); KDP's actual rule *content* (`KDPRuleSet`'s real data) remains pending the Decision-2 spike, per this project's own "confirmed, not guessed" discipline.

```typescript
// Domain port
interface PublishingTarget {
  prepare(book: Book, renderedOutputs: RenderedOutputs): PublishingReport;
}

interface RenderedOutputs {
  pdf?: Buffer;
  epub?: Buffer;
  docx?: Buffer;
}

// Domain model
interface PublishingReport {
  status: 'PASS' | 'FAIL';
  target: string; // e.g. 'kdp'
  issues: PublishingIssue[];
  warnings: string[];
}

interface PublishingIssue {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  severity: 'ERROR' | 'WARNING';
}

// Domain service (SubmissionValidator) - mirrors RuleRegistry/ValidationEngine exactly
interface PostRenderValidationRule {
  evaluate(context: PostRenderValidationContext): PublishingIssue[];
}

// KDPRuleSet - data, not logic; pending the Decision-2 spike for real values
interface KDPRuleSet {
  requiredMetadataFields: (keyof BookMetadata)[]; // pending spike
  coverSpec: { minWidthPx: number; minHeightPx: number; minDpi: number }; // pending spike
  // further fields pending spike
}
```

**Presentation:** `POST /api/manuscripts/publish` (Decision 4) — multipart DOCX + `target` field (only `'kdp'` valid this sprint, mirrors `ExportController`'s existing `resolveFormat`-style validation) → `PublishingUseCase.execute()` → JSON `PublishingReport`, not a file stream.

---

## 6. Risks

1. **Reversing `VISION.md`'s own original architectural framing (Decision 1) is a bigger call than a typical Level 2 review makes** — flagged explicitly, now locked by explicit CTO decision rather than left as a recommendation.
2. **No real KDP spike exists yet** — Decision 2 makes this a hard prerequisite, not optional, before `KDPTarget`/`KDPRuleSet` code is written.
3. **Scope creep into real automated submission** — closed by Decision 5's explicit, unambiguous boundary.
4. **`ASTBuilder` still can't populate ISBN/description/cover-image from a real DOCX** — any KDP-readiness check this engine runs against a real imported manuscript will, today, always fail on metadata completeness (same category as Sprint 5/6's own disclosed, unfixed import-pipeline gaps). Real, not a defect this engine introduces.
5. **KDP's real specifications change over time, independent of this project's release cycle (CTO-added risk).** The engine must never hardcode KDP's current requirements as logic. Decision 6's `KDPRuleSet` isolation (data, not conditionals inside `KDPTarget`/`SubmissionValidator`) is the mitigation — a future spec change is a data update to `KDPRuleSet`, not a code change to the engine. This is now a locked architectural constraint, not just a stated intent, per Decision 6.

---

## 7. Commit Plan

Approved by the CTO as "very prudent," matching their own stated order (Spike → Port → Validation → API → Tests → Documentation). Refined into concrete commits now that Decision 6's decomposition is locked:

1. **Commit 0 — KDP publishing-requirements spike** (`backend/spikes/kdp-publishing-spike.ts`), before any preset/port code — real metadata requirements, real cover spec, real file-naming/submission rules, matching ADR-0019/0020/0030
2. **Commit 1 — `PublishingTarget` port + `PublishingReport`/`PublishingIssue` models** (Domain)
3. **Commit 2 — `Packaging`** (assembles book + cover + metadata into a `PublishingBundle`)
4. **Commit 3 — `SubmissionValidator` + `PostRenderValidationRule` family + `KDPRuleSet`** (real values from the spike, isolated as data per Decision 6/Risk 5)
5. **Commit 4 — `KDPTarget`** (the only `PublishingTarget` implementation this sprint, wires `Packaging` + `SubmissionValidator`)
6. **Commit 5 — `PublishingUseCase`** (Application layer, mirrors `ExportManuscriptUseCase`)
7. **Commit 6 — `POST /api/manuscripts/publish`** route (Presentation)
8. **Commit 7 — Real-file verification pass** against canonical fixtures, per `docs/REAL_FIXTURE_POLICY.md`
9. **Commit 8 — Docs/ADR reconciliation**, per every prior sprint's own closure discipline

---

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

Reinforced by explicit CTO checklist (2026-07-18) — Sprint 8 is accepted only if **all** of the following are true, each independently verified against the real running application, not asserted:

- ✓ A real DOCX is imported
- ✓ A real PDF is generated
- ✓ A real EPUB is generated
- ✓ Real KDP validation is executed (`SubmissionValidator` + `KDPRuleSet`, real findings against a real manuscript)
- ✓ A detailed `PublishingReport` is produced (real itemized PASS/FAIL/Warnings, not a hardcoded success)
- ✓ No Amazon dependency exists anywhere in the code path
- ✓ No authentication of any kind is implemented or required
- ✓ No remote API call is made to any publishing platform
- ✓ No real publication occurs, under any circumstance
- ✓ The architecture is extensible to Kobo, Apple Books, and Lulu **without modifying any public interface** — a future `KoboTarget` implements the same `PublishingTarget` port unchanged
